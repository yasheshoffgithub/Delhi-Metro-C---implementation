# 🚇 Delhi Metro C++ Implementation

## Overview

Welcome to the **Delhi Metro C++ Implementation** project! 🎉 This project aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient C++ implementation of the Delhi Metro system. It includes various features to simulate metro operations, manage metro routes, and more. Currently, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is under development to enhance user interaction and experience. 🚀

## Features

- **🛤️ Route Management:** Create, update, and delete metro routes.
- **🏙️ Station Management:** Add, remove, and modify stations in the network.
- **🔍 Pathfinding Algorithms:** Implementations of algorithms to find the shortest path between stations.
- **📚 Data Structures:** Efficient data structures to handle metro operations.
- **🔄 Simulation:** Simulate metro operations and passenger flow.
- **⚡ Performance:** Optimized for performance with C++ best practices.

## Upcoming Features

- **🖥️ Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A user-friendly GUI is currently under development. This will make it easier to interact with the metro system and visualize routes and operations.
